[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is a privacy focused Linux variant designed to be used in a disposable fashion. It can run in a way which leaves no trace on the computer being used. You can also install it on a system, and make use of multiple users if you so desire. A common operating pattern seems to be making use of a "live USB" Tails install, and keeping any persistent data on a second encrypted USB drive.
