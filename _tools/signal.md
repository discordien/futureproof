# Overview

The Signal application is an open source tool provided by [Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/). It makes use of the same end to end encryption technology as WhatsApp. In 2016 it underwent an audit, and seemed to do [quite well](https://threatpost.com/signal-audit-reveals-protocol-cryptographically-sound/121892/).

As part of their [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guide, the EFF has provided some great guides on getting up and running with Signal on your mobile device.

Signal also works on the Desktop, as long as you are OK with using Chrome. It is available in the Chrome [Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk). This seems to work pretty well on Mac, Windows, and ChromeBooks.

The nice thing about Signal, compared to WhatsApp (or other Whisper using systems), is that the servers which are used to not log very much metadata. The user experience is slightly less intuitive, but still quite functional for a modern mobile application.
